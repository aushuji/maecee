"I don’t think you know this yet,",

"It wasn’t loud or overwhelming.",
"It happened quietly, almost without me noticing.",
"This time, it didn’t give me butterflies in my stomach,",
"and my emotions weren’t all over the place.",
"Instead, there was calm.",
"I wasn’t confused about how you felt or left wondering where I stood.",
"Instead, you made me feel wanted,",
"safe,",
"and reassured",
"and that was something I didn’t know I needed this much.",
"………",
"At first, I felt shocked.",
"Surprised.",
"Everything felt new again,",
"and honestly, I was scared.",
"I was afraid to try,",
"afraid to risk my heart one more time.",
"But somewhere along the way,",
"I realized something important:",
"you are worth every risk.",
"Because finally, for the first time in a long while,",
"love doesn’t feel heavy or uncertain.",
"It feels steady.",
"It feels genuine.",
"This time, it feels right.",
"………",
"………",
"To be honest,",
"I’ve never been good at telling people how I feel.",
"But you make me want to try.",
"You make me want to step past the awkwardness,",
"to take small risks,",
"to find a way to tell you how much you mean to me.",
"It’s not always easy, and I may not get it perfect,",
"but for you,",
"I’m willing to try.",
"Because being with you",
"even just the thought of it",
"feels like the most beautiful thing",
"I never knew I was waiting for.",
"………",
"Before this year ends,",
"I just wanted to say something small but honest.",
"I know we’ve only known each other for about a month,",
"and somehow, we’ve found ourselves here already.",
"I didn’t expect it,",
"but I’m really grateful that I met you when I did.",
"Being with you feels calm and natural,",
"and that means a lot to me.",
"I’m not trying to rush anything",
"I just wanted you to know that meeting you this year was something special for me,",
"and I’m thankful for what we’re building together,",
"slowly,",
"sincerely,",
"and steadily.",
"………",
"Here’s to today, tomorrow, and always.",
"Happy New Year, Mac🌼",
"May we make many beautiful memories together.",
"I love you",
"Always In all ways.",
